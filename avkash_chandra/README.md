The 3 APIs I selected for this objective was from my taste in music on listening on Spotify.

For this project, the three APIs I chose that provide a vast efficiency of music-related data and the different ways they can be analyzed together are as follows:

Spotify API – The Spotify API provides access to music tracks, albums, artists, and playlists, and also current user's top tracks and track features. This is were the bulk of the music data will be coming from especially as I use Spotify as my main app too.

Genius API – The Genius API provides detailed song lyrics and artist information, giving insights into the meaning and background of the music and the artist. This was something I was also able to find through the publc API website as sometimes in songs I would want to know the meaning and Genius provides a great insight on it.

Last.fm API – The Last.fm API tracks insights into song popularity, trends, and information about the songs. This API was seleclted due to finding data on some statistical measures such as trends and engagement.

The objective I am going to use the APIs together is by using Spotify's data on songs and artists and then using Genius data on detailed lyrics on songs for better meaning and then finally using the Last.fm data for popularity trends and engagent data. I am then able to anaylze songs and artists and dive into the meanings of what the artist is trying to portray while looking at trends and engagement for those songs.
