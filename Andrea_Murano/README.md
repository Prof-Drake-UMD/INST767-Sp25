# American't: Finding a New Home in Europe!

## Project Description:
American't is a recommendation system for those who are looking to move from America to Europe. This system considers cost of living, spoken languages, neighborhood amenities, job opportunities, and more! Users will be able to input preferences and the system will suggest cities that best suit their needs.

## APIs Used:
1. **Eurostat API:** Provides data about job opportunities, economic conditions, and general safety information in European countries.
2. **Google Places API:** Offers insight into potential lifestyle by providing data about public transport, local businesses, and other neighborhood amenities.
3. **Geonames API:** Supplies geographic data and population demographics, to include languages spoken, which is a big consideration for English speakers moving to Europe.
