When Margaret invites them both for a one-month trial period, after which she’ll choose the person who’ll tell her story, there are three things keeping Alice’s head in the game. One: Alice genuinely likes people, which means people usually like Alice—and she has a whole month to win the legendary woman over.

Although Violet's body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else's, she still has her wits--and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules. But a determination to survive won't be enough this year. Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College--and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end."" --",0,['Fiction'],,,NOT_MATURE,en,http://books.google.com/books?id=EY69EAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9781649374172&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=EY69EAAAQBAJ&dq=isbn:9781649374172&hl=&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EY69EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EY69EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api,,,,"{""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""NOT_FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": false}","{""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""NO_PAGES"", ""embeddable"": false, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EY69EAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""NONE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}","{""kind"": ""books#volume"", ""etag"": ""wsSzrtsLnnI"", ""selfLink"": ""https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/EY69EAAAQBAJ"", ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""She&#39;s survived her first year at Basgiath War College for dragon riders.but the danger&#39;s just beginning in the electrifying, pulse-pounding follow-up to the Fourth Wing by USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Yarros.""}, ""volumeInfo_readingModes"": {""text"": true, ""image"": false}, ""volumeInfo_allowAnonLogging"": false, ""volumeInfo_contentVersion"": ""preview-1.0.0"", ""volumeInfo_panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}}"

The Names is startlingly joyful and paced like a thriller…Knapp tirelessly and beautifully replicates not just loss and grief but endless rebirth and delight.” —The Washington Post “Elegant. . . this is a wholly original work.” —People Magazine ""Book of the Week"" “A magnificent novel, thrumming with life in all its pain and precariousness, yet suffused with the glorious possibilities of love and redemption.” —Geraldine Brooks, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Horse The extraordinary novel that asks: Can a name change the course of a life? In the wake of a catastrophic storm, Cora sets off with her nine-year-old daughter, Maia, to register her son's birth. Her husband, Gordon, a local doctor, respected in the community but a terrifying and controlling presence at home, intends for her to name the infant after him. But when the registrar asks what she'd like to call the child, Cora hesitates... Spanning thirty-five years, what follows are three alternate and alternating versions of Cora's and her young son's lives, shaped by her choice of name. In richly layered prose, The Names explores the painful ripple effects of domestic abuse, the messy ties of family, and the possibilities of autonomy and healing. With exceptional sensitivity and depth, Knapp draws us into the story of one family, told through a prism of what-ifs, causing us to consider the ""one . . . precious life"" we are given.
