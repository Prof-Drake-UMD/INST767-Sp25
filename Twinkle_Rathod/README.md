# Gun Violence Data Integration Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end data pipeline using Google Cloud Platform on gun violenceâ€“related data from three major U.S. cities of Chicago, Washington D.C. and New York City. It aims to study trends on firearm-related incidents in every city. 

## API Data Sources

Below are the three public APIs selected for this project. These APIs offer incident-level gun violence data and are updated regularly.

Which neighborhoods in D.C. and boroughs in NYC report the most firearm-related incidents?
How have firearm-related incidents trended over the past 12 months in each city?
How do firearm-related injury rates vary across states, according to the CDC?
Is there any correlation between urban gun violence (DC/NYC) and state-level firearm death rates (CDC)?
