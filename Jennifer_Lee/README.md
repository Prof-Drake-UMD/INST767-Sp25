For my project, I will be creating a DAG for financial market data. 

I will be using https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance, https://publicapis.io/coin-gecko-api, and https://publicapis.io/fred-api.

The first API contains data on Yahoo Finance, and it consists of financial market data. The inputs will be ticker symbols, and the expected outputs will be information on stocks such as historical prices and volume. 

The second API is CoinGecko and contains information on cryptocurrency prices. The inpus will be cryptocurrency IDs, and the expected outputs will be the price (in USD), market cap, and volume. 

The third API is the Federal Reserve Economic Data and has macroeconomic data. The inputs will be Series ID, and the expected outputs will be time-series data for macroeconomic indictors. 

I will use all of these APIs to analyze trends in the stock and crypto market and study correlations with macroeconomic factors. I will then model and forecast future movements in the market.
