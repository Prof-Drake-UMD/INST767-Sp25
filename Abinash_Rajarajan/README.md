# **Food Truck Location Optimizer**

## **Overview**
The **Food Truck Location Optimizer** is a data pipeline project designed to help food truck owners identify the best locations to operate. By analyzing **local events**, **weather conditions**, and **competition**, the project provides actionable insights to maximize customer foot traffic and sales potential.

The pipeline integrates data from three public APIs:
1. **Ticketmaster API**: To fetch information about local events that attract large crowds.
2. **Yelp API**: To gather information about nearby restaurants and food trucks for competition analysis.
3. **OpenWeatherMap API**: To obtain current weather conditions that influence customer turnout.

The project processes, transforms, and loads the data into **Google BigQuery**, enabling advanced analytics and visualization.
